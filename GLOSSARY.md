# Startup Accelerator
Startup Accelerators are 3 to 6 month programmes that help you move swiftly in your startup journey. The best time to get into an accelerator is when you already have a prototype or early customers as accelerators can help you increase the pace of getting customers through their network and connections. Accelerators also help you get noticed by early stage investors and give you a good platform to launch your product. The YCombinator Accelerator at Silicon Valley sets the Gold Standard. The way most accelerators work is that they give you a fixed amount of money, space and their resources in exchange for a fixed amount of equity.
