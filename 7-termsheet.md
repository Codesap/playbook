#Termsheet

During the process of raising funds, if you get an investor (VC/Angel) interested in investing in your startup, you will come across a document called the termsheet. This is not a legally binding document. But, it is a preliminary document that presents the broad terms of the proposed investment. For understanding the details, you can avail the help of a lawyer, but as the founder, it is a good idea, to spend some time understanding yourself, certain curicial aspects of the the termsheet.

The entrpreneur wants the best terms possible for him, while the investor is on the other side of the table, looking for the best terms favorable to him. Look for those investors, who are being frank and direct, rather than those who propose convoluted terms in the term sheet, and might give you a preliminary impression that their offer is the best, but a deeper look might prove to be otherwise.

Well, for any investment, the concerned parties have to agree on a **valuation** for the startup and decide on the **quantum of investment** (amount of money being invested by the investor). How you arrive at these numbers, is a separate issue. Let's assume you have agreed upon these, based on the stage of the startup, how promising the potential is, relative metrics, financial needs, competitive landscape and other reasons. Now, comes the stage, when the investor will move on to finer details and present you with a termsheet. The investors is looking at maiximizing returns from his investment, while trying to minimizing risk from the investment. To accomplish this, the investor is going to focus on 2 things in any termsheet:
* Economics (Valuation)
* Control (Decision-making power)

There will be several terms in the termsheet. Here, we will focus on some of the prominent ones. Below is a list of resources, which you can refer to, for details. Some of the terms in a termsheet:
* Pre-money/Post-money Valuation
* Option Pool
* Liquidation Preference
* Board Control
* Right of First Refusal (ROFR) and Co-Sale
* Drag-Along

## Pre-money/Post-money Valuation
As discussed in [Raising Investment](6-raising-investment.md), pre-money valuation is the valuation of your startup, before you have taken any money from the investor.
