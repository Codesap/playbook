#Termsheet

During the process of raising funds, if you get an investor (VC/Angel) interested in investing in your startup, you will come across a document called the termsheet. This is not a legally binding document. But, it is a preliminary document that presents the broad terms of the proposed investment. For understanding the details, you can avail the help of a lawyer, but as the founder, it is a good idea, to spend some time understanding yourself, certain curicial aspects of the the termsheet.

The entrpreneur wants the best terms possible for him, while the investor is on the other side of the table, looking for the best terms favorable to him. Look for those investors, who are being frank and direct, rather than those who propose convoluted terms in the term sheet, and might give you a preliminary impression that their offer is the best, but a deeper look might prove to be otherwise.

Well, for any investment, the concerned parties have to agree on a **valuation** for the startup and decide on the **quantum of investment** (amount of money being invested by the investor). How you arrive at these numbers, is a separate issue. Let's assume you have agreed upon these, based on the stage of the startup, how promising the potential is, relative metrics, financial needs, competitive landscape and other reasons. Now, comes the stage, when the investor will move on to finer details and present you with a termsheet. The investors is looking at maiximizing returns from his investment, while trying to minimizing risk from the investment. To accomplish this, the investor is going to focus on 2 things in any termsheet:
* Economics (Valuation)
* Control (Decision-making power)

There will be several terms in the termsheet. Here, we will focus on some of the prominent ones. Below is a list of resources, which you can refer to, for details. Some of the terms in a termsheet:
* Pre-money/Post-money Valuation
* Option Pool
* Liquidation Preference
* Board Control
* Right of First Refusal (ROFR) and Co-Sale
* Drag-Along

### Pre-money/Post-money Valuation
As discussed in [Raising Investment](6-raising-investment.md), pre-money valuation is the valuation of your startup, before you have taken any money from the investor. Let's say the pre-money valuation is INR 3 crores and you, the founding team, owns the entire company. Let's say, the investor decides to invest INR 1crore. Then the post-money valuation is INR 4 crores. So, after the *dilution* (by taking in money from investor, your % of ownership in the startup will decrease or get diluted), your stake gets reduced to 75% and investor gets a 25% stake.

## Option Pool
Option Pool, is a reserve of stock, set aside for employees. It is a way of attracting talented employees to a startup and to keep them incentivised. (After a certain period, employees can exercise a stock option and convert it into common stock)
In the above example, we saw that post-money, your stake gets reduced to 75% and investor gets 25% stake. Let us say, the investor insists on having an option pool of 15% on a *post-money* basis. Observe that, what this means is that, on a *pre-money* basis, option pool of 20% must be there (After dilution, the pre-money option pool of 20%, gets diluted by 75% to a post-money option pool of 15%). Assume that you, the founder had not kept aside any option pool, when you went to raise funds. Then, effectively, you will have to first dilute your 100% stake in the company to 80% and set aside 20% for the option pool, even before you bring in any funds. So, although your *nominal* pre-money valuation is INR 3crores. Your *effective* pre-money valuation is INR 2.4 crores (80% of INR 3crores). Post-dilution, you will have 60% stake, investor will have 25% stake and there will be an option pool of 15%. Notice that, with the addtion of an option pool clause, the *effective* pre-money valuation that you are getting might be very different from the *nominal* pre-money valuation. In a termsheet, generally, the *nominal* pre-money valuaiton will be mentioned and it is for you to calculate the other details.
