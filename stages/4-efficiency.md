# Efficiency


## Tests for Efficiency



## Typical Activities

* Value proposition refined
* UX optimized, 
* Conversion funnel optimized
* Viral growth achieved
* Repeatable sales process and/or scalable customer acquisition channels found.

## Average Duration

The average duration for the Efficiency stage is 8-12 months.

## Common Failures

* Raising too little money. You need money to drive experiments and user growth.
* Raising too much money. This might seem like a contradiction, but too much money makes founders indisciplined. Remember: money is not the solution to your problems, it's just a means to arrive at it.
* Having more than 1 level of hierarchy.
* Overcompensating missing product/market fit with marketing and press. Marketing and Press does not equate to business success, when used effectively they are a tool to rope in customers.
