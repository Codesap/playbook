# Idea Discovery

The Idea Discovery stage is the first (& perhaps least understood) stage in a startup. Entrepreneurs are always in a rush to build something so there's a huge tendency to skimp on this stage. Well, why shouldn't you? To understand this, let's examine two harsh realities in the life of any entrepreneur.

1. **To make a viable business, you have to build a product that your customers want.**

   Please read that sentence again. The corollary is that **if you don't make a product that people want**, your business will fail right from day one. The intent of the Idea Discovery stage is to hit upon a product idea that people do want.

2. **On average, to make any business viable, an entrepreneur spends 4-8 years.**

   Let that sink in. Even if your product idea is great, it'll take you up to eight years to succeed. If you idea isn't however, you've lost a lot of time working on something people wouldn't want. If you are going to spend a significant chunk of your working life on a startup, why shouldn't you take some time and think about if you are working on the right idea?

## The Right Idea

Let's get this straight from day one: there's no formula or checklist for what makes an idea great. Nobody predicted the success of Twitter, and even fewer predicted the rise of casual games such as Angry Birds. Sure, after the fact there were signs pointing to such products being ripe, but it's hard to predict the future. However, all is not lost: there are three tests entrepreneurs use to figure out a "possibly good" idea.

1. Am I solving a real genuine problem that people have?

   This test is the best of the three. Talk to people (or better yet, develop a habit of observing them) to figure out genuine problems that people have. Come up with great products to solve those problems.

2. Will you (& your friends) use it?

   This is perhaps one of the most important tests. It's a reasonable indication of whether people would want it, but more importantly, it's a good test of whether you will be committed to the product for the duration it's required to make it successful.

3. Has it been done before? And why is mine better?

   Although often ridiculed as copycat products, people forget that Facebook wasn't the first social network. Neither was Google the first search engine. They just had quantifiably better products. Improving upon an inefficient or unusable existing product is a good way to begin. Or adapting it to a different reality: take the example of Flipkart, often called the Amazon of India but which innovated and brought Cash-On-Delivery to the eCommerce product ecosystem.

## Typical Activities

Here are the typical activities that are found in the Idea Discovery stage:

* Founding team is formed.
* Prospective customers are interviewed.
* A Value Proposition is found.
* Team joins an accelerator or incubator (hint: SV.CO)
* Team raises small bit of funding from friends and family.
* First mentors & advisors come on board.

## Average Duration

The average duration for an Idea Discovery stage is 3-5 months[^1].

## Objective

The Objective for the team at this Stage is to select an idea that the team believes users will want.

## Key Result

The Key Result is a Product Deck that describes this idea.

Let's talk a look now at individual roles and how that leads to the above Key Result:

## Product Role
The Product role is the most important role at this stage. Generally, the person in the Product Role drives all discussions until the team agrees that a viable value proposition has been found.

* This Startup Class lecture is a great video about [How to Get Great Ideas](https://startupclass.co/courses/how-to-start-a-startup/lectures/64057).
* Lean Canvas is a mechanism to describe and think about your idea in detail. You needn't fill in all of the fields when you start first, but try to think exhaustively about all of them. Sign up for [a training video here](http://leanstack.com) and you can [download a blank Lean Canvas here](resources/lean-canvas.pdf). Print this out and fill it with your whole team.
* [Experiment Board](http://www.javelin.com/experiment-board.html) is a technique to very quickly validate a product idea and solution even without prototyping. The focus on cheap validation and "getting out of the building" are amazing lessons to learn for a budding entrepreneur.

* GV.com has a [great series of articles on Product Management](http://www.gv.com/library/product-management). Do go through all of them.

## Engineering Role
Because this stage is before you actually build anything, Engineers can do a lot of pre-work. Setting timeline expectations, deciding on a technology stack and thinking about sustainable programming are good activities to perform.

Resources:

* [Are Your Lights On? - How to Figure Out What the Problem Really Is](http://www.amazon.in/Are-Your-Lights-Figure-Problem/dp/0932633161/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1429623285&sr=8-1&keywords=Are+Your+Lights+On%3F%3A+How+to+Figure+Out+What+the+Problem+Really+Is) is one of the best books about problem solving. Engineers spend most of their time solving problems in code. Identifying what the business problem really is, and finding the best and most maintainable way to solve it is crucial.
* [Good Programming is like Good Writing](http://bigthink.com/videos/good-programming-is-like-good-writing) expounds on one of the best comparisons to programming possible: that of writing.
* [SCRUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29), the Wikipedia page has a series of pointers on this Agile development method and why it's useful. Great SCRUM practices are a good way to drive constant iterative development.
* Version Control is one of the basic hygiene activities that Software Engineers must adopt. Even if you are working in the Hardware space, finding a way to version your assets is crucial. Here's [an interactive tutorial for Git](https://try.github.io), one very popular source control management tool.

## Marketing & Sales Role

WIP.

Resources:

* [The Single Biggest Reason Why Startups Succeed and Fail](http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gross_the_single_biggest_reason_why_startups_succeed) is a great punchy video! Timing matters.
* [Writing a Business Plan](https://www.sequoiacap.com/grove/posts/6bzx/writing-a-business-plan) from Sequoia gives you the bare essentials of what a business plan has. At this stage you should have an idea about potential market size, a first marketing plan, and things you should do to scale up.

## Governance Role
WIP.

You will give a formal name to your company and get it registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
You can incorporate it as a private limited company or a partnership. At this stage, you can get in touch with a Company Secretary and a Chartered Accountant. The Company Secretary will assist you with the incorporation of your company and Chartered Accountant will assist you with future tax filing for the company. It is good to build relations with these professionals at this stage.

## Design Role
Design is not how it looks, it's how it works. A great startup team will have great design as one of its fundamental building blocks. What makes great design? Here's some material to help you out.

Resources:

* [GV.com Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) is a popular assimilation of many design techniques into a complete and coherent workflow. In the context of a product team, it provides an actionable series of steps to move from zero design to tested and usable designs.
* For visual and user-interface design, there's no better site to follow than [Behance](https://www.behance.net), especially the [Graphic Design](https://www.behance.net/search?field=44&content=projects&sort=appreciations&time=week) and [UI/UX sections](https://www.behance.net/search?field=132&content=projects&sort=appreciations&time=week).
* The video [Principles of Good Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWoprlPMBnA) brings together two of the most well-known designers in recent times: Dieter Rams & Jonathan Ive to describe what is considered the fundamental principles of great design.
* And to top it off, here's the original quote by Steve Jobs: [Design is How it Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPfJQmpg5zk)

## Common Failures

* Typically, startups fail at this stage because they fail to find a value proposition for the product. Or in more simple terms, they fail to identify a first customer.
* Teams also fail if they are over-staffed and can't manage financial resources properly. Successful startups have lean teams and focus on quick iterations.

## Proceeding to Prototyping

Once you've conceptualized an idea your team thinks is promising, it's time to proceed to [Prototyping](2-prototyping.md).
