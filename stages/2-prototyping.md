# Prototyping

While you might create some artefacts during the Idea Discovery stage, it's at Prototyping that your team shows off the first version of your product. This is a crucial intermediary step where the Engineering role has prominence. Prototyping also helps you refine your initial idea, and to weed out parts that are not feasible to build with your current team.

There are two different kinds of prototypes you can build:

* **Low-fidelity prototypes** are usually sketches that real users interact with as if it was your product.

  The most common form of low-fidelity prototyping is using paper sketches, with each sketch representing one stage of your app, and a user interacting with the sketch by pointing to portions of it as if he was tapping or clicking on it.

  Low-fidelity prototypes are useful if you want to quickly clarify an idea and see it in action.
* **High-fidelity prototypes** resemble your actual product very closely, mimicking design and often the exact placement of user-interface elements.

  At the Prototyping stage, we recommend that you build high-fidelity prototypes. In fact, we recommend you build these prototypes as if they would eventually evolve to your actual application. This means the highest fidelity possible: actual programming, real work on design and UX, and good copywriting.

## A Good Prototype

What constitutes a good prototype? Here are a few tests you can use:

1. Can it test the business assumptions you have made in the Discovery stage?

   This is a crucial test of a good prototype. As an example: if your product is a new app for newly married couples, one of your assumptions could be that your product would help them interact in a more meaningful fashion. If your prototype does not have sufficient methods for them to interact, and does not show enough user interaction, it could be flawed.

2. Does it have enough functionality to resemble the actual product in character?

   This is often a hard-to-judge test, but a common mistake new founders make is to build prototypes that implement only one of the lesser important features in your product. Ideally, your prototype should have all of the crucial features that your product would have, but implemented in a less polished fashion. You should be able to defend when asked why other lesser important features haven't been implemented yet.

3. Can **real** users interact with it easily?

   A prototype is only as useful as the results it brings about when users test it. Sometimes founders test the prototypes on themselves, or their close friends. This is usually like a self-fulfilling prophecy: of course you would love your own product and would find features you developed super-obvious to use. A good test of the prototype only happens when real users test it. And for that, the prototype has to be delivered and packaged so that your *real target audience* can interact with it.

## Typical Activities

Here are the typical activities you would have in the Prototyping Stage:

* Deciding on Technology Stack
* Building a Prototype
* Iterating a Prototype
* Collecting Feedback from Real Users
* Finalizing a Development Workflow
* Raising Seed Fund
* Getting Licenses or Devices for Prototyping
* Looking for a Workplace

## Average Duration

The average duration of the Prototyping stage is 3-5 months.

## Common Failures

* Startups fail at this stage when they are not able to build a high-fidelity prototype. This usually points to failures within their Engineering role, but at times issues are more systemic: perhaps the Idea they discovered could have been too ambitious.
* Another common failure is to attempt to build too much. While protoypes much exhaustively test core features, ancialliary features should be left untested so that teams can build within the budget available.
