# Prototyping

While you might create something to show for the Idea Discovery stage, it's at Prototyping that your team builds the first version of your product. This is a crucial intermediary step where the Engineering role has prominence. Prototyping also helps you refine your initial idea, and to weed out parts that are not feasible to build with your current team.

There are two different kinds of prototypes you can build:

* **Low-fidelity prototypes** are usually sketches that real users interact with as if it was your product.

  The most common form of low-fidelity prototyping is using paper sketches, with each sketch representing one stage of your app, and a user interacting with the sketch by pointing to portions of it as if he was tapping or clicking on it.

  Low-fidelity prototypes are useful if you want to quickly clarify an idea and see it in action.
* **High-fidelity prototypes** resemble your actual product very closely, mimicking design and often the exact placement of user-interface elements.

  At the Prototyping stage, we recommend that you build high-fidelity prototypes. In fact, we recommend you build these prototypes as if they would eventually evolve to your actual application. This means the highest fidelity possible: actual programming, real work on design and UX, and good copywriting.

## A Good Prototype

What constitutes a good prototype? Here are a few tests you can use:

1. Can it test the business assumptions you have made in the Discovery stage?

   This is a crucial test of a good prototype. As an example: if your product is a new app for newly married couples, one of your assumptions could be that your product would help them interact in a more meaningful fashion. If your prototype does not have sufficient methods for them to interact, and does not show enough user interaction, it could be flawed.

2. Does it have enough functionality to resemble the actual product in character?

   This is often a hard-to-judge test, but a common mistake new founders make is to build prototypes that implement only one of the lesser important features in your product. Ideally, your prototype should have all of the crucial features that your product would have, but implemented in a less polished fashion. You should be able to defend when asked why other lesser important features haven't been implemented yet.

3. Can **real** users interact with it easily?

   A prototype is only as useful as the results it brings about when users test it. Sometimes founders test the prototypes on themselves, or their close friends. This is usually like a self-fulfilling prophecy: of course you would love your own product and would find features you developed super-obvious to use. A good test of the prototype only happens when real users test it. And for that, the prototype has to be delivered and packaged so that your *real target audience* can interact with it.

## Typical Activities

Here are the typical activities you would have in the Prototyping Stage:

* Deciding on Technology Stack
* Building a Prototype
* Iterating a Prototype
* Collecting Feedback from Real Users
* Finalizing a Development Workflow
* Raising Seed Fund
* Getting Licenses or Devices for Prototyping
* Looking for a Workplace
* Hire Key Employees

## Average Duration
The average duration of the Prototyping stage is 3-5 months.

## Objective
The Team Objective at this Stage is to build a working prototype.

## Key Result
The Key Result is a Product Deck that details your prototype and customer feedback. A working version of the prototype should be demonstrated to your SV.co representative.

Let's talk a look now at individual roles and how that leads to the above Key Result:

## Product Role
Product folks are crucially involved during the prototyping stage building out the product. But this is also a good time to explore other solutions to your idea. A good understanding of a competitor landscape can be crucial at this stage.

Resources:

* It's time to take a closer look at [Design Sprints](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) introduced in the last stage. You should train yourself and your team in the Sprint language.
* Start and complete the [Udacity Course on Product Design](https://www.udacity.com/course/product-design--ud509). It's a collaboration between Google & Udacity and has great sections on Design Sprints and Key Metrics.
* Attend a few great conferences: particularly from the folks at [Hasgeek](https://hasgeek.com). While a few of them might be overly technical, lots like [Meta Refresh](https://metarefresh.in/2015/) provide valuable insight and extend your network.
* Join the [Closed Club newsletter](http://closedclub.org) (towards the bottom of the page) that will give you insight about why products failed: this is as crucial as knowing why some succeeded.

## Engineering Role

The Engineering Role during Prototyping is all about building. The resources below all reflect that.

Resources:

* [Rubymonk)](https://rubymonk.com) is a great resource to learn Ruby (a great programming language for prototyping web apps) and more interestingly, TDD or Test-Driven Development, a method to build more maintainable software.
* This [Udacity course on Android](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) gives you a great introduction to build Android apps.
* This [iTunes U Stanford Course](https://itunes.apple.com/bj/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099) will teach you build great iOS applications in Swift.
* If you are building a hardware prototype, these [series of video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&v=U2fUvCFNyI0) will teach you to build one using Arduino. 
* [Lookback](https://lookback.io) is a great tool to understand how people actually use your app.
* [Material Design Template for Bootstrap](http://designbeep.com/2014/10/25/material-design-template-for-bootstrap-3/) lets you quickly start up with a web template.

## Marketing & Sales Role

TBD!

## Governance Role

WIP.

This stage will involve procurement of licenses or devices needed for prototyping. You will have to be actively on the look out for hiring key people. You will need to identify a good workplace and accordingly sign off on the lease/rental agreeement. Identify required infrastructure for the startup and put them in place.

* [OKRs by Google](https://www.gv.com/lib/how-google-sets-goals-objectives-and-key-results-okrs) are a great way to motivate and guide your team to meet business goals.

## Design Role

* [What makes a Design Intuitive](https://startupclass.co/courses/how-to-start-a-startup/lectures/64065) is a great read from Startup Class. It's got pointers to think about when designing your prototype.
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) provides free high-resolution photos.
* [Material UI](http://material-ui.com/#/) is a great introduction to Google's Material Design Principles. Similarly, [Apple iOS HIG](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/) is a great intro to Apple's design language. Both are must reads for a any app designer.
* [GoodUI.org](http://goodui.org) has simple tips for good UX.

## Common Failures

* Startups fail at this stage when they are not able to build a high-fidelity prototype. This usually points to failures within their Engineering role, but at times issues are more systemic: perhaps the Idea they discovered could have been too ambitious.
* Another common failure is to attempt to build too much. While prototypes much exhaustively test core features, ancillary features should be left untested so that teams can build within the budget available.

## Proceeding to Customer Validation

When are you done with the Prototyping stage? When sufficient number of customers say very clearly that your product is usable and has promise. You move on to the [Customer Validation stage](3-customer-validation.md).
