# Customer Validation


## Defining Validation



## Typical Activities
These are the typical milestones in the Customer Validation stage:

* Refinement of core features, 
* User growth
* Metrics and Analytics implementation, 
* Seed funding
* Hiring Key Employees
* Pivots (if necessary)
* First paying customers
* Product-market fit

## Average Duration

The average duration for the Customer Validation stage is 6-12 months.

## Common Failures

* The biggest reason why startups fail at this stage is that they spend too much on customer acquisition before product-market fit. At this stage, you are still looking to find viable customers for your product.
* Building a product without problem/solution fit.
* Hiring too many people too early, or hiring "experts" before they become critical.
