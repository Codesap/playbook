# Customer Validation


## Defining Validation



## Typical Activities
These are the typical milestones in the Customer Validation stage:

* Refinement of core features, 
* User growth
* Metrics and Analytics implementation, 
* Seed funding
* Hiring Key Employees
* Pivots (if necessary)
* First paying customers
* Product-market fit

## Average Duration

The average duration for the Customer Validation stage is 6-12 months.

## Common Failures

* The biggest reason why startups fail at this stage is that they spend too much on customer acquisition before product-market fit. At this stage, you are still looking to find viable customers for your product.
* Building a product without problem/solution fit.
* Hiring too many people too early, or hiring "experts" before they become critical.

## Product Role

The Product person has an important role to play during Customer Validation. It's he who decides experiments to perform during this stage, and who along with the team decides metrics the team has to hit before moving on.

## Engineering Role

The Engineering role provides support to the others and is focused on implementing experiments quickly and thoughtfully. It's important that Engineers focus on building a stable and quick-to-iterate platform with little technical debt.

Resources:

* Engineers must understand frameworks available for [A/B Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing), a crucial tool available during this stage to design experiments.
* A good familiarity with the [NIH Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) is essential. Put simply, instead of reinventing the wheel, learn how other companies solve similar problems and adopt their tools and solutions.
* Setting up [Continuous Integration](http://youandthegang.com/2015/continuous-integration-delivery-with-jenkins/) at this stage is nice!
* [Librato](https://www.librato.com) is an easy turnkey solution to collect metrics. It's built on top of the opensource [Collectd](https://collectd.org) and [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com). [Grafana](http://grafana.org) is an alternative to Librato that is free.


## Marketing & Sales Role

* For App Marketers, it's useful to understand [ASO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_store_optimization).

## Governance Role

## Design Role

The person who handles Design can use this stage to try out different UX experiments. It's also crucial to build a company-wide design language that everybody can adopt when building new interfaces. Because this might be a time of quick iteration, designers must also learn how to make quick and dirty experiments work great.

* Product Hunt has a collection of [tools for designers](http://www.producthunt.com/e/tools-for-designers) that could become super useful at this stage.
