# Startup Roles

Just like there are five stages, in a good startup, founders pay attention to five roles:

* Product

  The Product role is about detailing out the product ("What are you building?") & guiding it through constant iterative changes.

* Engineering

  The Engineering role builds out the product and understands business and technology tradeoffs.

* Marketing & Sales

  The Marketing & Sales role fleshes out to who and how the product is sold.

* Governance

  Governance is about building in legally & fiscally compliant processes that drive efficiency.

* Design

  The Design role thinks deeply about user experience and visual design of the product.

It's cohesive working of these five roles that builds a good startup team and subsequently, a great product.

## Can I Wear Multiple Hats?

In a small startup team, it's the norm for a founder to wear multiple hats. As an example, perhaps the Product person also is the Engineer who bootstraps the product. Or one founder takes care of both the Marketing & Sales roles and Goveranance. While we think this practice is okay, we can't stress the importance of having these role distinctions learnt from day one. And as startups mature, towards the latter stages, most of these roles become full-time jobs.

Role groupings that usually go together:

* Engineering and Product
* Product and Design
* Marketing & Sales and Governance

How do you pick a role? We think it's best to follow your passion:

* If you've always been excited about programming, pick the Engineering role. But do realize that good Engineering is not just about staring at code, but also about understanding how best to translate business goals into a great system.
* If you're excited about the great new products that come out every day and constantly follow websites such as [Angelist](http://angel.co/) or [Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com/), you might be fit for the Product role.
* If you are an extrovert who loves to talk and meet new people, the Marketing & Sales role might be for you. However, a good marketing person also has great analytical skills and is able to build a logical and sensible sales plan.
* If you have training in finance or as a chartered accountant or a lawyer, you should pick the Governance role.
* If you have a background in Design, it's obvious which role you should pick.

## Next Steps

What's the most important role? It's surprising how often we hear this question from young entrepreneurs. The answer should be obvious: all of them are. But that's probably reads a non-answer to you. The reason for this is that the importance of roles waxes and wanes as we move between stages. In the Idea Discovery stage for example, the Product person has a very important role to play to flesh out the product and its iterations. Similarly, the Prototype stage cannot be completed without an effective Engineer. Does this mean that in these stages the other roles are sitting idle?

As we'll see, every role plays a crucial part in every stage. Let's start with the [Idea Discovery stage](6-idea-discovery.md).
