# Startup Stages

The basis of the SV.co platform for event verification is startup stages. We've modeled this closely on Marmer Stages[^1] but added in a stage specifically for prototyping because we think it's a crucial intermediary step towards good product development.

When you join Startup Village, your representative will classify you into one of these five stages:

* [**Idea Discovery**](stages/1-idea-discovery.md)

  This is where the startup discovers a product idea that solves a clear user need.
* [**Prototyping**](stages/2-prototyping.md)

  This is where the team develops a prototype that is a solution to the product idea.
* **Customer Validation**

  This is when customers either use or pay for the product.
* **Efficiency**

  This is where customer acquisition is refined and a sound business model is discovered.
* **Scale**

  This is when startups try to aggressively grow.

Some important points to note before we proceed:

* One insight that we've received from working with many startups is that they cycle through several different stages during their development. At each stage, priorities of the startup team would be different, and the milestones that they have to hit to move to a more mature stage is unique. A lot of startups fail because they have the wrong priorities for their stage.  What we've tried to do through the SV.co platform is to accurately identify what stage a startup is in, and then provide resources that are helpful to them at that particular stage.
* Startups also rarely move unidirectionally: instead most move through multiple iterations and pivots before they achieve scale. We've noticed that most startups that succeed go through more than two pivots and persevere through multiple iterations before their product hits customer validation. It's probable that a first-time founder will spend two years just reworking his original idea.
* Do keep in mind that as we've mentioned before, at Startup Village, there are [six ways to succeed](introduction.md).

Let's move on to describing the first stage: [Idea Discovery](stages/1-idea-discovery.md).
