# Introduction

At Startup Village, we think everyone can learn to become an entrepreneur. And we think the best time to pick up these skills and build great startups is when you are young, even while you are still in school or college. 

We believe that the Internet is a significant game changer for humanity and we are seeing the early days of a massive global revolution. Because learning as we know it was institutionalized in the early 18th century, schools and colleges are organized just like factories with separate areas for different subjects and they teach topics in order, just like batch production at a factory.

Startup Village is just like your college or University but we have a new model of learning for the Internet-era generation. While your college might teach you Engineering, we teach you how to build a Startup.

Here's how Startup Village compares to a traditional school or college:

| Area | Colleges & Schools | Startup Village |
|------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Admission | Colleges admit an **individual** | Startup Village admits a **team** |
| Learning | **Teachers** and guides lecture you about topics | Mentors help you out, but **self-learning** is emphasized | 
| Evaluation | Theory **exams**, with practical labs | **Practical results** that you produce with your knowhow |
| Graduation | You score above the pass percentile and get a **job**, or you go for **higher education** | **Six ways** to graduate |

## Six Ways to Graduate

At Startup Village, we give you six ways to successfully graduate:

1. **Get funded**
  
  Your startup gets funded through a venture capital firm or an angel investor.
2. **Get into a Startup Accelerator**

  Your team is selected into a recognized Startup Accelerator.
3. **Get Aqqui-Hired**

  Your founding team is hired on by another company that values your skills.
4. **Become Self Sustainable**

  Your revenue and cashflows stabilize and then grow, allowing you to scale up.
5. **Get a job**

  You get hired at a great company because of the skills that you acquired while building your startup.
6. **Go for Higher Education**

  You decide to build upon the skills you acquired by getting a formal degree.
  
At Startup Village, all of these are perfectly happy outcomes. We think the much hyped story of a founder striking it big from his garage is good press, but building a startup can be about much more than a good exit. If you are one of those few founders who make it big, great! But building a great startup can help you with all of these six different journeys.

## Next Steps

Hope that gives you a good soundbite. The rest of this guide is in two parts. The first: about how the Startup Village application process works, and how we guide and evaluate startups. You'll also learn about features like Startup Timelines that allow you to accurately record progress in your Startup journey. 

The second & longer part is about stages in the life of a startup, typical activities you perform, and learning resources that are available to help you out. You'll gain an understanding of the five stages involved in any startup, and the five roles we think are crucial in any startup team.

You needn't read this guide cover to cover. Instead, focus on the areas that seem interesting to you and read just that.
