# Introduction

At Startup Village, we think everyone can learn to become an entrepreneur. And we think the best time to pick up these skills and build great startups is when you are young, even while you are still in school or college. 

We believe that the Internet is a significant game changer for humanity and we are seeing the early days of a massive global revolution. Because learning as we know it was institutionalized in the early 18th century, schools and colleges are organized just like factories with separate areas for different subjects and they teach topics in order, just like batch production at a factory.

Startup Village is just like your college or University but we have a new model of learning for the Internet-era generation. While your college might teach you Engineering, we teach you how to build a Startup.

Here's how Startup Village compares to a traditional school or college:

| Area | Colleges & Schools | Startup Village |
|------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Admission | Colleges admit an **individual** | Startup Village admits a **team** |
| Learning | **Teachers** and guides lecture you about topics | Mentors help you out, but **self-learning** is emphasized | 
| Duration | A **structured duration** of semesters or thesis evaluations | You **learn at your own pace** and you move ahead when you are ready |
| Evaluation | Theory **exams**, with practical labs | **Practical results** that you produce with your knowhow |
| Graduation | You score above the pass percentile and get a **job**, or you go for **higher education** | **Six ways** to graduate |

This Startup Playbook is curated information that will guide you through the startup journey. This entire book can be read in two weeks but to practice it and become an expert is a life long process. The more you practice, the more skilled you become. There is no need to memorise anything. There is no need to learn formulae by heart. Everything is available on the Internet and you can check any video or web link at any point of time.
 
There is no need to be afraid as well because there is no final exam. Building a startup is a continuous creative process. You become better at this with the experience you get. Close to no one gets it right in the first try and thus you need to keep releasing the product and keep iterating it over. The best version of Android is always the next one: perfection is a work in progress.

Building a Startup is a creative adventure and is the perfect mix of Science, Arts & Humanties. As you get exposed to these diverse fields, your options in life also increase with the new skills and experiences you gain while you build a startup.

## Six Ways to Graduate

At Startup Village, we give you six ways to successfully graduate:

1. **Get funded**
  
  Your startup gets funded through a venture capital firm or an angel investor.
2. **Get into a Startup Accelerator**

  Your team is selected into a recognized Startup Accelerator[^1].
3. **Get Aqqui-Hired**

  Your founding team is hired on by another company that values your skills.
4. **Become Self Sustainable**

  Your revenue and cashflows stabilize and then grow, allowing you to scale up.
5. **Get a job**

  You get hired at a great company because of the skills that you acquired while building your startup.
6. **Go for Higher Education**

  You decide to build upon the skills you acquired by getting a formal degree.
  
At Startup Village, all of these are perfectly happy outcomes. We think the much hyped story of a founder striking it big from his garage is good press, but building a startup can be about much more than a good exit. If you are one of those few founders who make it big, great! But we are happy with any and all of these outcomes.

Building a great startup can help you with all of these six different journeys. The world we live in needs you to have enough money to live a decent life. Enough money is the amount you require to do the things you love throughout your life, without having to worry about how to pay your bills. To get money, you have to work.

You can either work for someone or you can work for yourself. We believe that by doing a startup, you can do what you love and work for yourself.

## Next Steps

Hope that gives you a good soundbite. The rest of this playbook is in two parts. The first: about how the Startup Village application process works, and how we guide and evaluate startups. You'll also learn about features like Startup Timelines that allow you to accurately record progress in your Startup journey. 

The second & longer part is about stages in the life of a startup, typical activities you perform, and learning resources that are available to help you out. You'll gain an understanding of the five stages involved in any startup, and the five roles we think are crucial in any startup team.

You needn't read this playbook cover to cover. Instead, focus on the areas that seem interesting to you and read just that.

[^1]: Startup Accelerators are 3 to 6 month programmes that help you move swiftly in your startup journey. The best time to get into an accelerator is when you already have a prototype or early customers as accelerators can help you increase the pace of getting customers through their network and connections. Accelerators also help you get noticed by early stage investors and give you a good platform to launch your product. The YCombinator Accelerator at Silicon Valley sets the Gold Standard. The way most accelerators work is that they give you a fixed amount of money, space and their resources in exchange for a fixed amount of equity. To get in touch with Accelerators in India, please your contact SV.CO representative.
