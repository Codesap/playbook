# Verified Timelines

Verified timelines are aimed at tackling one of the biggest problems a new entrepreneur faces: uncertainty (or "What do I do now?"). When used correctly, they answer three questions:

1. What will my startup journey look like?
   
   Teams at the start of every entrepreneurship journey have a lot of incorrect assumptions. Starting a company is rarely a get-rich-quick scheme. In fact, most entrepreneurs fail a lot of times before finding a correct product-market fit. By exploring timelines of other startups, you'll be able to understand how they succeeded: often only after multiple iterations.
   
   In addition, setting expectations right for your team is important from day one, and verified timelines help you do that.
2. What should my team be focused on right now?

   The most frequent question that entrepreneurs ask mentors is: "What do you think I should do now?" Timelines provide a set of *common activities* that startups should and more importantly, *should not do* at particular stages.
3. What help will I receive from Startup Village at my stage?

   Because startups are part of the SV.co platform, they receive numerous benefits and incentives. As they move through stages, new benefits and resources open up. These could be diverse things like access to funding rounds, connections with mentors or access to our new FAB Lab. The platform and our representatives keep you updated with the latest benefits you can apply for.
   
## Timelines in Brief

This is what a typical timeline looks like:

!TODO: Image of timeline from some good startup with multiple iterations.

There are a few concepts you should understand:

* **Timeline events** are notable milestones in your startup journey. These could be for example: a team member joining, a fundraising event, registering with MSME, or developing a new prototype. All timeline events are verified by Startup Village.
* **Iterations** are different versions of your startup. You may perhaps start with one idea and decide there is no demand, and start a new iteration with another idea.
* **Pivots** happen when you launch a new iteration. Pivots are common, and often a useful tool to focus your team on a different idea.
* **Stages** are stages of your startup journey. At SV.co [we support startups through five stages](!TODO: link to stages). Note that when you pivot and start a new iteration you might go back a stage. This is perfectly OK! As an example, a team can develop an idea until the Scaling stage and decide that while they have customer adoption, the product is too hard to scale. They can then go back to the drawing board, refine the idea based on their learnings & new skills and build a new product entirely. In fact, this is encouraged.

Here are few example of common timeline events:

Here's how an iteration is represented, and where a pivot happens:

Here's when a team moved back from a Customer Validation stage back to the Idea Discovery stage:

## Keep your Timelines Updated

This is the single most important piece of advice you'll receive as part of the SV.co program: make sure your timeline data is in sync with your startup.

There are several reasons that entrepreneurs usually think up *not to* update their timelines. All of these are the wrong reasons:

1. Your current idea is not getting traction and you are looking for that one big break before you update your timeline.

   One of the indicators that we rank startups in internally is velocity, or how fast they move within and between stages. One of the best correlations that we've found for successful startups is to find folks who always communicate: in good times and bad. It doesn't matter if your product is not achieving customer validation. Perhaps you have added a business partner to help you explore more options? Or you've pivoted to a different sector? Communicate through your timelines. It's very important that you do. We **recommend you update your timelines every week** and procure  evidence that your SV.co representative recommends to make it a verified entry.

2. There's nothing happening that is important enough to update.

   While there are lulls in any startup, a continuous period of inactivity is a danger signal. Perhaps you need to rethink your approach?

3. Some of my founders left and I'm struggling to make ends meet.

   Adversity affects every startup. Again, please see point 1. Communicate in good times and bad. 
   
   Also please note that we have six avenues to graduate. Please talk to your SV.co representative and figure out more options.
   
In fact if there's one good reason to not update your timelines it's that there's something exciting happening to you that you'd like to update but it's something that we don't currently verify. Please talk to your SV.co representative and let's add that timeline event in.

## Next Steps

That's the quick overview of our most important feature: Verified Timelines. Currently, you update your timelines by notifying your SV.co representative about major timeline events, but we have an exciting timeline editor in the works.

This concludes Part 1 of our guide. Next, we talk about Startup Stages and Roles and then in detail about internal and external resources available to guide you at each stage.
